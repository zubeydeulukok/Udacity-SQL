# **Window Functions**
We will cover window functions.
## **Two Use Cases for Window Functions**
- When you want to measure trends or changes over rows or records in your data.
- When you want to rank a column for outreach or prioritization.
In other words,
- to understand a running total or a running metric while maintaining individual records
- to rank a dataset

A few cases where you’d have these needs are described below:

### **Measuring change over time:**
- Has the average price of airline tickets gone up this year?
- What’s the best way to keep the running total orders of customers?
### **The ranking used for outreach prioritization:**
- Use a combination of factors to rank companies most likely to need a loan.
