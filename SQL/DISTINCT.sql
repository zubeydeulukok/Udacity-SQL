-- DISTINCT is always used in SELECT statements, and it provides the unique rows for all columns written in the SELECT statement. 
-- Therefore, you only use DISTINCT once in any particular SELECT statement.

-- DISTINCT SYNTAX
-- SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3
-- FROM table1;

-- You would not write:
-- SELECT DISTINCT column1, DISTINCT column2, DISTINCT column3
-- FROM table1;

-- DISTINCT - Expert Tip
-- Itâ€™s worth noting that using DISTINCT, particularly in aggregations, can slow your queries down quite a bit.

SELECT account_id,
       channel
FROM web_events
GROUP BY account_id, channel
ORDER BY account_id;


SELECT DISTINCT account_id,
       channel
FROM web_events
ORDER BY account_id;

-- Questions: DISTINCT
-- 1. Use DISTINCT to test if there are any accounts associated with more than one region.
SELECT a.id as "account id", r.id as "region id", 
a.name as "account name", r.name as "region name" 
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r ON r.id = s.region_id;

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM accounts;

-- Consequently;
--  two queries have the same number of resulting rows (351), so we know that every account is associated with only one region. 
-- If each account was associated with more than one region, the first query should have returned more rows than the second query.

-- 2. Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?
SELECT *
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id;

SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY num_accounts;

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM sales_reps;

-- The above queries show that;
-- Actually, all of the sales reps have worked on more than one account. 
-- The fewest number of accounts any sales rep works on is 3. There are 50 sales reps, and they all have more than one account. 
-- Using DISTINCT in the second query assures that all of the sales reps are accounted for in the first query.
